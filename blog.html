				<h1>La Colombe - Ethiopia Yirgachefe</h1>
				<p>La Colombe is one of the best roasters on the market and their Ethiopia Yirgachefe is pretty good.  It is a little light for my taste, but so far I have only been able to try it in my drip machine.  I have a feeling it will taste better as a pour over or French Press.</p>
				<p>I mentioned this coffee had a lighter taste, and according to the box there would be notes of 'lemon zest' and 'peach'.  I didn't really get that in the first round.  The first taste was a smooth cup and had the general qualities of a "normal cup of coffee".  The second cup tasted more watered down and similar to a light cup of coffee that lacks some flavorful punches that I prefer in more of a dark roasted blend.  Overall, this is fine for someone looking for a coffee that will not scare your company or for those who do not enjoy darker roasts.  I would place this more towards a typical breakfast blend and light roast rather than medium.</p>

				<h1>Partners - Manhattan Blend</h1>
				<p>Partners, formerly known as Toby's Estate, has a variety of coffee and expresso beans to choose from.  I decided to try their Manhattan Blend.  It said "filter" on the bag, so I assumed that it would work well with my machine rather than the pour over.  I was wrong.</p>
				<p>After the brewing, the flavor and taste of the coffee was extremely watered down.  After a while, there was a better taste of the coffee flavor once might be accustomed to, but overall, this fell flat.  Partner's "Brooklyn" blend is more superior in taste and style.  When I used it in the pour over you could taste a better cup than with the machine, but overall I was not impressed with this blend.</p>

				<h1>Doma - Guatemala</h1>
				<p>The past month I have been part of a coffee subscription service called "Trade".  Trade matches you with a variety of coffee companies throughout the United States.  I was intrigued by this as it would allow me to try coffee that I otherwise may never get to try.  Doma, a coffee roasting company from Idaho, brings a lovely Guatemalan blend that is smooth as silk, and has the right amount of coffee bitterness that makes for a lovely cup of coffee for breakfast.  Doma has a decent amount of variety in their beans, and I would gladly order from them again as this is a company that puts in a great amount of time, love, respect and style to their coffee.</p>
				<p>As their company founder Terry Patano says, "We are passionate about coffee — and we’ve built a life around this passion." And it shows in the product.</p>

				<h1>Porto Rico Importing Company - Hazelnut Blend</h1>
				<p>If you live or have visited New York City, one of the best places to purchase coffee by the pound is Porto Rico Importing Company.  They have one of the largest selections of roasts, blends, teas, etc.  One of the best flavored coffees I have had is their hazelnut blend.  It has the taste and aroma of hazelnuts the moment you grind, to the moment it appears in your coffee pot.  While I recommend using this type of coffee for your machine, I recently tried this coffee with the pour over method, and I must say, the sweetness of the hazelnuts shined more so than in the machine.  It also was a smoother cup of coffee.  My guess is my ratio of water to coffee was better.  But for the same cup of coffee each time, I would still recommend the machine.</p>
