				<h1>Drip Coffee Maker</h1>
				<p>One of the most popular methods for brewing coffee.  The coffee maker is found in nearly every department store for purchase, along with specialty coffee shops.</p>
				<p>There are numerous companies that have a brand of coffeemaker for purchase, ranging from economic value like <a href="https://www.mrcoffee.com/coffee-makers/" target="_blank">Mr. Coffee</a> to higher end products like <a href="https://us.moccamaster.com/" target="_blank">Moccamaster</a>.</p>
				<p>While it isn't necessary to have the most expensive maker on the market, there are numerous differences between a cheap maker vs. expensive maker.  Most noticable is the temperature to which the water hits the grounds before heading to the carafe.  Temperature should be somewhere between 195 to 215 degrees to pull the best flavours from the coffee itself.  It it is hotter or cooler, then the coffee, which could taste the way you want it, may be subpar.</p>

				<h1>Pour Over</h1>
				<p>Another popular way to make coffee at home and at the coffee shops, is the pour over method.  This is done by taking a cone line structure, sitting it on a cup or a glass carafe, and then using the hot water from a gooseneck kettle to gentle extract the coffee from the beans.  This method takes more time and care to get the cup right.  You have to watch it nearly the entire time, as the time and weight are essentail to creating the best cup of coffee from the beans.</p>
				<p>For myself, I grind the beans similar to the machine drip setting on my grinder, place a cone-shaped filter on the Hario v60 plastic holder, heat the water with the kettle, run water around the filter, place the grounds (approximately 34 grams) into the filter, and finally begin to pour the water, gently, around the grounds.  The important part is watching the amount of grams on the scale.  I begin to pour the water until it reaches 60 grams, and then wait for the timer to read 40 seconds.  This allows the "bloom" to happen.  If the beans are in good shape, you will see bubbles form as the gas begins to escape.  Next, continue to pour the water until the scale reaches 200 grams.  When the timer reaches 1 minute 10 seconds, the third pour can begin.  Conintue to pour the water into the filter until it reaches 300 grams.  The timer needs to continue until it reads 1 minute 40 seconds.  We are now in the final pour, which will bring the scale up to 360 grams.  Then you let the pour over continue for three-five minutes.  You can then pour the coffee into your mug and enjoy.</p>

				<div class="info">
				<h1>French Press</h1>
				<p>French Press is a unique way to make coffee, though very popular in the United States.  It creates an extremely different tasting coffee than the machine and pour over as the grounds sit in the water for a lengthly period of time (5 minutes).  Then the grounds are pressed down by the plunger and you get your cup of coffee.  The acidic nature of the coffee has pretty much disappeared and the cup will be smooth, but very heavy in flavor and texture.  I enjoy this method every so often, but it isn't my first choice as I am not a big fan of the heavier feel of the coffee.  The flavor of the coffee is more prominent as well.</p>
				<p>For this method, I put the French Press on my scale, boil the water, run some of the hot water into the press to clear it out, and then set my grinder to the course setting (usually the far left of the monitor), set it to 8 cups, and then wait for the grounds to come out.  Next, place the grounds at the bottom of the press.  Start the timer and begin to pour the hot water until the scale reaches 800 grams.  Note, this might be less if the coffee looks like it will overflow at the top of the press. You do not want that as when you start to put the plunger on the press, a mess will happen, trust me.  Take a wooden utensil and stir gently for a minute to push the grounds into the water.  Do not over sir.  When the timer states 5-6 minutes, press the plunger down and push the grounds to the bottom. You coffee is ready to drink.  If you are looking for a decent press, I recommend anything by <a href="https://www.bodum.com/us/en/coffee/coffee-makers" target="_blank">Bodum</a>.</p>

				<h1>Moka Pot</h1>
				<p>The Moka Pot is an older method that is still used today in many parts of the world.  It is a good way to make espresso without buying an expensive espresso machine.  It sits on the stove over medium heat, then percolates, bringing the coffee through a small spout at the top.  While, this method isn't one of my go to methods, it does create a lovely cup of coffee/espresso as it has one of the smoothest textures around.</p>
				<p>For this method, grind your beans to the finest setting.  34 grams of beans and 455 grams of water.  Put the water in the base of the moka pot, then place the grounds in the filter section of the pot.  Place on medium or medium high heat and let the water boil.  The water will shoot up through the filter, and then the coffee will push through a spout at the top.  Take off the heat when the coffee has finished and enjoy.</p>
